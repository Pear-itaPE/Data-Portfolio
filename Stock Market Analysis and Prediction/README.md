Project Structure:

    Introduction and Problem Statement:
        Explain the objective of the project, which is to analyze historical stock market data and develop a predictive model for future stock prices.

    Data Collection and Preprocessing:
        Describe the sources from which you'll collect the stock market data (e.g., API, web scraping, CSV files).
        Show how you preprocess the raw data, including handling missing values, outlier detection, and data cleaning.

    Exploratory Data Analysis:
        Perform descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of stock prices and key financial indicators.
        Visualize the data using plots, charts, and graphs to gain insights into the stock market trends, patterns, and correlations.

    Feature Engineering:
        Engineer relevant features from the available data, such as moving averages, technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD), and financial ratios.
        Explain the rationale behind the selected features and their potential impact on the predictive model.

    Model Development:
        Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm for stock price prediction, such as linear regression, decision trees, or recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
        Split the data into training and testing sets and train the model using the training data.
        Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared).

    Model Evaluation and Interpretation:
        Analyze the model's performance on the test data and interpret the results.
        Discuss any limitations or challenges encountered during the modeling process.

    Deployment and Visualization:
        Implement a user-friendly interface to showcase the stock market analysis and prediction results.
        Create interactive visualizations (e.g., line plots, candlestick charts) to present the predicted stock prices alongside the actual prices.

    Conclusion and Future Work:
        Summarize the project findings, including the accuracy of the predictive model.
        Reflect on potential improvements, such as incorporating more sophisticated algorithms, using alternative data sources, or exploring ensemble methods.
